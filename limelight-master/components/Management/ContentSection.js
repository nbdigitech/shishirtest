          Having lived in metros, smaller cities and even towns that have only
          recently started developing into cities, we have developed a uniquely
          keen perspective towards India.
          <br />
          <br />
          From the way people are connected to each other, to the symbiotic
          relationship they have with nature and even small town economics, we
          have worked to brand and dynamically rebrand Indiaâ€™s small towns and
          aspiring cities.
          <br />
          <br />
          Small town dynamics work differently from cities. At the same time
          they have a lot more to offer with a true Indian touch.
